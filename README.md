# **_üì∞ Fake News Detection System_**

## **_üåü Overview_**

In today‚Äôs digital era, the proliferation of fake news has become a significant issue, affecting public opinion and spreading misinformation. This project tackles this problem by developing an advanced machine learning system designed to classify news articles as true or fake. By leveraging cutting-edge algorithms and a user-friendly web interface, this solution aims to provide an accessible and reliable tool for detecting misinformation and improving media literacy.

### **_Key Features_**
- **Automated Classification**: Uses machine learning to distinguish between true and fake news articles.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple web application for real-time news article classification.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Ensures high availability and performance with cloud-based deployment.

## **_üéØ Project Objectives_**

- **Accurate Classification**: Develop a robust model to classify news articles into categories such as true news, fake news, and potentially other relevant categories.
- **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Implement advanced preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare data for optimal model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive web application for users to easily input news articles and receive instant classification results.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Deploy the application on a cloud platform to manage traffic efficiently and ensure global accessibility.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Facilitate ongoing enhancements to the model and application based on user feedback and technological advancements.

## **_üìä Data Preparation_**

### **_Datasets_**
- **Source**: Datasets obtained from Kaggle, including collections of true and fake news articles.
- **Data Sources**:
  - [Kaggle Fake News Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news](https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection))

### **_Preprocessing Steps_**
1. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensure unique entries to avoid redundancy.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Address NaN values and inconsistencies through imputation or removal.
3. **Dealing with Hyperlinks**: Strip out hyperlinks to focus on the content.
4. **Removing Punctuation**: Eliminate punctuation marks to standardize text.
5. **Text Standardization**: Convert text to lowercase and perform other standardizations for consistency.

## **_ü§ñ Model Training_**

### **_Implemented Models_**
- **Logistic Regression**: A foundational model for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Tree**: A decision-making model based on feature values.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting model known for its high performance.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A model that finds the optimal boundary between classes.

### **_Evaluation Metrics_**
- **Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of correctly classified articles.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Additional metrics to evaluate model performance, particularly for imbalanced datasets.

## **_üåê Web Application Development_**

### **_Technologies Used_**
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python framework for backend development.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating a clean and responsive frontend.

### **_Features_**
- **News Article Input**: Users can input news articles for classification.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Provides immediate feedback on article authenticity.
- **Results Display**: Shows classification results and confidence scores.

## **_üöÄ Deployment_**
